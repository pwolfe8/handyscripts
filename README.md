## Toggle Static IP Script

This toggles a network interface between static and normal IP.
Type in the name of the network interface listed that you want to change
Then the number of your desired configuration (1 for normal DHCP provided IP, 2 for static IP)
If you want to always choose the same network interface then uncomment the interfaceName variable on line 3 and type in whatever you want as your default.

Feel free to make a shortcut to this on your desktop.
